| Task | Task Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|T.2.1 | Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building one, encompassing the campus backbone. Integration of every member's Packet Tracer simulations into a single simulation.        |
|T.2.2 | Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building two, encompassing the campus backbone.                                                                                          |
|T.2.3 | Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building three, encompassing the campus backbone.                                                                                        |
|T.2.4 | Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building four, encompassing the campus backbone.                                                                                         |

# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses 		the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

  * Totally implemented with no issues
  * Totally implemented with issues
  * Partially implemented with no issues
  * Partially implemented with issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.

(Examples)
## 2.1. 1111111 - Structured cable design for building A, floors 2 and 3 #
### Totally implemented with no issues. ###
## 2.2. 2222222 - Structured cable design for building B, floors 0 and 1 #
### Totally implemented with issues. ###
The number of outlets in room X is incorrect.
A better solution for the cable pathways between the floor 1 		distributer and rooms Z and Y should be found.
## 2.3. 3333333 - VLAN devices configuration for building C #
### Partially implemented with no issues. ###
The VLAN CCCC with VLANID 400 has not been implemented.
The VTP configuration is not present in switch DD.
## 2.4. 4444444 - IPv4 addressing and routing configurations for building D #
### Partially implemented with issues. ###
The IPv4 network TTT has not been implemented.
The routing table at router FF has the wrong mask for network YYY.
Nodes on network CCC are not receiving the default-gateway by DHCP.
