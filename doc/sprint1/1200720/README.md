===========================================

## Identification of the structured cabling standards used

- Minimum of 2 outlets per work area.
- Proportion of 2 outlets for every 10 square meters of area.

## Building 3

### Scale measure:

![scale.png](images/scale.png)
- 2,8 cm (scale) = 5m (reality)

### Building measurement:

![measurementBuild.png](images/measurementsBuild.png)

- As the building has the shape of a square, it was only necessary to measure one of its sides and convert this measurement to the real scale.

| Build | Length (m) | Width(m) | Area(m2) | 
|-------|------------|----------|----------|
| 3     | 19,64      | 19,64    | 385,84   |


## Building 3 - Floor 0

### Calculated information:
| Room    | Length (m) | Width (m) | Area (m2) | Number of outlets |

### Relevant Justifications:

* Example of how the size of the rooms in the image was converted to their actual size.
![conversionExample.png](images/conversionExample.png)


* After having done the process of converting the size of the rooms in the image to their real size, it was necessary to calculate the area of each room. As the rooms are rectangular, it was only necessary to multiply their length by the width after converting the units. Below we will show an example of how the calculations were made.
