## These were the followed structured cabling standards:
- Minimum of 2 outlets per work area.
- Ratio of 2 outlets for every 10 square meters of area.

### Important Remarks:

- So that the plants dimensions could be measured, the provided scale was used. Its real length of 5m
is equivalent to 2.7cm on an A4 printed sheet.


- Once the measurements were performed, the obtained measures 
were converted using the following formula:

- Each room and both floors are considered geometric rectangles. So, it's possible to obtain an area
by just multiplying a division's length by its width.

# Building 2 

## Ground Floor:
